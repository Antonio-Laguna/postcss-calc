# Contributing

The following outlines a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Asking questions

Prefer asking questions in the [PostCSS chat](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss) over opening issues.
Leveraging the community would likely get you an answer faster, as well as leave us available to solve issues and make the product better. 

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a new issue, be sure to make a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, leave a comment on the existing issue instead of opening a new one. 

If no prior issue exist, create a new one. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Summarize the problem you are having.
* Include details about your configuration and environment.
* Provide steps to reproduce the problem.
* Describe what behavior you expected to see.

## Requesting Enhancements

Before submitting a new issue, be sure to make a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been requested. If no such issue exists, create a new one and detail it to the best of your ability: 

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Provide a description of the proposed enhancement. 
* Exemplify what needs/uses this enhancement would address. 

## Submitting Pull Requests

Before contributing any code to the project, be sure to either open a new issue in the issue tracker detailing what you intend to contribute, or comment on an existing issue if one exists.
This allows us to:

* give feedback early on before significant effort has been put into the endevour. 
* align your contribution with ongoing efforts. 
* make sure that there's no ongoing effort into the issue already. 

When submitting your pull request, make sure that you: 

* use a clear and descriptive title. 
* summarize your contribution.  
* list the issues that this contribution addresses. 
* include tests for your contribution.
